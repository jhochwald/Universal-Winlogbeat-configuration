# Contribution Guide

This is a guide for everyone interested in contributing to our open source projects. It's based on well known community workflows.

I love PowerShell, and i love to share knowledge, you are encouraged to fork all my open source repositories and make adjustments according to your own preferences. If you really want to contribute, you should consider a [pull request](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/pulls), this will help me to improve and to share this improvement with the community.

## General Bug Report

If you report a bug, please try to:

- Perform a web / GitHub search to avoid creating a duplicate ticket.
- Include enough information to reproduce the problem.
- Mention the exact version (including our Build) of the project causing you problems, as well as any related software and versions (such as operating system, PowerShell version, dotNET Version, etc.).
- Test against the latest version of the project (and if possible also the master branch) to see if the problem has already been fixed.
- Include as many information as possible and needed to understand the issue.
- Include a link to a gist you provided (if applicable).

For a guide to submitting good bug reports, please read [Painless Bug Tracking](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html).

## Asking Questions

Depending on the nature and urgency of your question, pick one of the following channels for it:

- Search the web for it, you've done that already, right?
- StackOverflow, or other sites
- GitHub Issues from this and other projects (_The best option in my opinion_)
- Search the GitHub Gist repository
- Use the corresponding Gist and place a comment there, if exists
- Use the corresponding Blog Post and place a comment there, if exists
- Any major PowerShell related site

Do not email me directly, unless you have a very good reason. The only one that make sense to me: If you found a security related issue!

## Contributing Code

If you want to contribute code, please try to:

- Follow the same coding style as used in the project. Pay attention to the usage of tabs, spaces, newlines and brackets. Try to copy the aesthetics the best you can.
- When possible, add an automated ([Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester)) test that verifies your change.
- Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), explain what your patch does, and why it is needed.
- Keep it simple: Any patch that changes a lot of code or is difficult to understand should be discussed before you put in the effort. We can discuss that right here in the Issue tracker.

Once you have tried the above, create a GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/pulls) to notify me of your changes.
